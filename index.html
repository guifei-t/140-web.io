                <li class="p01">
                    I am a WMC student with a solid foundation in creating user-centered designs that enhance
                    the overall user experience. With expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various design tools, I
                    aim to combine functionality with aesthetics in every project. My interests include exploring
                    emerging
                    design trends, improving the accessibility of digital interfaces, and contributing to open source
                    projects.
                    Besides studying, I enjoy photography, badminton, and reading, which inspire my creative process and
                    broaden my perspective on design.
                </li>
                <li class="p02">The mission of this website is to showcase my resume, education, life and skills. In
                    addition to being a personal mission, this website also aims to connect with potential employers,
                    collaborators and fellow designers by providing some of my extracurricular life, practice works in
                    study, etc. If anyone is interested in my work or life, please contact me through the platform. If
                    you want to cooperate with the webpage, etc., you can also contact me.
