					<p>The Internet and the World Wide Web are two distinct but interconnected technologies that have
						revolutionized communication and information sharing. The Internet, which originated in the
						1960s,
						is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate using standardized protocols.
						The
						World Wide Web, invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, is a system of interlinked hypertext
						documents
						accessed via the Internet.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-box-page1">
					<p>The Internet's origins can be traced back to ARPANET, a project funded by the U.S. Department of
						Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). ARPANET was designed to enable researchers
						to
						share data and access remote computers. The first message sent over ARPANET was in 1969, marking
						the
						birth of the Internet. Over the years, the Internet evolved with the development of protocols
						like
						TCP/IP, which standardized data transmission and allowed different networks to interconnect.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-box-page1">
					<p>The World Wide Web, on the other hand, was created to make information sharing on the Internet
						more
						accessible. Tim Berners-Lee developed the first web browser, called WorldWideWeb (later renamed
						Nexus), and the first web server. The Web uses Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to transfer
						web
						pages, which are written in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). The first website, created by
						Berners-Lee, provided information about the World Wide Web project itself.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-box-page1">
					<p>Early Internet technologies played a crucial role in the development and expansion of the
						Internet.
						Email, one of the earliest applications, allowed users to send messages electronically. Telnet,
						a
						protocol for remote computing, enabled users to access computers over a network. Secure Shell
						(SSH)
						later replaced Telnet, providing encrypted communication for secure remote access.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-box-page1">
					<p>File Transfer Protocol (FTP) was developed to transfer files between computers on a network. It
						allowed users to upload and download files, making it easier to share data. Gopher, an early
						information retrieval protocol, organized information in a hierarchical structure, making it
						easier
						to navigate. However, it was eventually overshadowed by the World Wide Web.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-box-page1">
					<p>Web browsers like Lynx and Mosaic were instrumental in popularizing the Web. Lynx, a text-based
						browser, allowed users to navigate the Web using keyboard commands. Mosaic, developed by Marc
						Andreessen and Eric Bina, was the first graphical web browser, making the Web more user-friendly
						and
						visually appealing. Mosaic's success led to the development of Netscape Navigator, which became
						one
						of the most popular browsers of the 1990s.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-box-page1">
					<p>Hypertext, the foundation of the Web, allows users to click on links and navigate between
						documents.
						This interconnected structure made it easy to access related information and browse the Web. The
						combination of hypertext and graphical browsers transformed the Internet into a powerful tool
						for
						information sharing and communication.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-box-page1">
					<p>In summary, the Internet and the World Wide Web are distinct technologies that have transformed
						the
						way we communicate and access information. The Internet, a global network of interconnected
						computers, provides the infrastructure for data transmission. The World Wide Web, a system of
						interlinked hypertext documents, makes information sharing on the Internet more accessible.
						Early
						Internet technologies like email, telnet, SSH, FTP, HTTP, Gopher, browsers like Lynx and Mosaic,
						and
						hypertext played a crucial role in the development and expansion of the Internet and the Web.
