                    <h3>Vannevar Bush, D.Eng</h3>
                    <p>Vannevar Bush was an American engineer and science administrator. He played a crucial role in the
                        development of the early concept of hypertext and the Memex, an electromechanical device that he
                        envisioned as a personal, automated information storage and retrieval system.</p>

                    <h3>Doug Engelbart, Ph.D</h3>
                    <p>Doug Engelbart was a computer scientist best known for inventing the computer mouse. He is also
                        credited with the development of hypertext, groupware, and the concept of human-computer
                        interaction. Engelbart's "Mother of All Demos" in 1968 showcased many of these innovations.</p>

                    <h3>Ted Nelson, Ph.D</h3>
                    <p>Ted Nelson coined the term "hypertext" and envisioned a non-linear system of information
                        organization. He advocated for a comprehensive, interconnected information network, a precursor
                        to
                        the World Wide Web. Although his Xanadu project did not achieve widespread success, his ideas
                        influenced the development of hypertext and the web.</p>

                    <p>Co-founders of Apple Inc., Jobs and Wozniak were instrumental in the personal computer
                        revolution.
                        The Apple I and II computers, designed by Wozniak, contributed significantly to the
                        popularization
                        of personal computing, laying the groundwork for later developments in networking and the

                    <h3>Tim Berners-Lee, KBE</h3>
                    <p>Sir Tim Berners-Lee is the inventor of the World Wide Web. In 1989, he proposed the concept of an
                        information management system that later became the foundation for the development of the first
                        web
                        browser and server. He also created the first website, establishing the protocols (HTTP, HTML,
                        and
                        URL) that form the backbone of the modern internet.</p>

                    <p>Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina developed the Mosaic web browser in 1993, which played a pivotal
                        role
                        in popularizing the World Wide Web. Mosaic was user-friendly and had a graphical interface,
                        making
                        the internet accessible to a broader audience and paving the way for subsequent web browsers.

                    <p>Rob Hartill is known for his contributions to the development of the Apache web server, one of
                        the
                        most widely used web servers on the internet. Apache played a key role in the growth of the
                        World
                        Wide Web by providing a reliable and scalable platform for hosting websites.</p>

                    <h3>Lou Montulli</h3>
                    <p>Lou Montulli was a key contributor to the development of the Netscape Navigator web browser. Lou
                        Montulli developed HTTP Cookies at Netscape in 1994 to help websites remember user preferences,
                        such as shopping
                        cart status. This invention greatly improved the user experience, but subsequent third-party
                        Cookies for advertising
                        tracking sparked privacy controversy. He also developed the Lynx browser and contributed key
                        technologies such as server
                        push.</p>

                    <h3>Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn</h3>
                    <p>Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn are often referred to as the "fathers of the internet." They co-designed
                        the
                        Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP), laying the foundation for
                        the
                        modern internet. Their work in developing these protocols was fundamental in enabling the
                        connectivity and communication that characterize the internet today.</p>
