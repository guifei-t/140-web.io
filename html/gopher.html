					<p>In the early 1990s, Gopher blazed a critical path through the bottleneck of the information
						superhighway. Gopher,
						developed by the University of Minnesota in 1991, was a groundbreaking protocol designed to
						streamline access to
						distributed network information. It utilized a hierarchical "directory of directories" system,
						enabling users to
						navigate and retrieve text-based resources efficiently. Gopher's simplicity and speed made it a
						preferred tool among
						academics and educational institutions in the early 1990s, offering a user-friendly solution to
						the
						growing demands of
						the "information superhighway".</p>
				</div>

				<div class="info-box">
					<p>Despite its initial success, Gopher faced significant limitations, such as its lack of multimedia
						support and commercial
						pricing policies. As the World Wide Web emerged with HTML and HTTP protocols supporting complex
						designs and multimedia
						content, Gopher quickly lost its competitive edge. By 1995, the majority of users and
						institutions
						had transitioned to
						the World Wide Web, leaving Gopher as a historical footnote in internet development.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="info-box">
					<p>Gopher's legacy, however, remains significant. It introduced concepts such as hierarchical
						navigation
						and was
						instrumental in popularizing the idea of "surfing the Internet," a term coined by Mark McCahill
						of
						the Gopher team.
						While Gopher is nearly obsolete today, it paved the way for user-centric internet applications
						and
						serves as a reminder
						of the rapid evolution of digital communication technologies.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="info-box">
					<p>Studying Gopher helps us understand the development of the Internet and shows how important early
						technologies are to
						today's web. It reminds us that innovation and adaptability are key to today's world.</p>
