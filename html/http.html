						<p>When the client wants to access a simple HTML page, it sends an HTTP or HTTPS request to the
							server.
						</p>
						<p>The request includes the URL of the page, telling the server the exact resource the client
							wants to
							access.</p>
						<p>The server receives the request and searches for the file in its storage directory.</p>
						<p>If the file is found, the server reads its content and sends it in HTML format back to the
							client.
						</p>
						<p>HTTP follows a request-response model where the client requests and the server responds with
							the
							data.
						</p>
						<p>HTTPS, however, adds a layer of security using SSL/TLS protocols to encrypt data transmission
							between
							the
							client and server.</p>
						<p>The HTTPS process can be broken down into four stages: TCP handshake, certificate validation,
							key
							exchange, and data transmission.</p>
						<p>First, a TCP connection is established between the client and server during the handshake to
							ensure a
							stable communication channel.</p>
						<p>Next, the server sends a digital certificate, and the client verifies its authenticity.</p>
						<p>If the certificate is valid, the client generates a session key and sends it to the server
							encrypted
							using asymmetric encryption.</p>
						<p>Once the key exchange is complete, both the client and server use symmetric encryption with
							the
							session
							key to encrypt the data during transmission.</p>
						<p>This ensures that even if the data is intercepted, the attacker cannot decrypt it without the
							session
							key.</p>
						<p>The server sends the encrypted content, and the client decrypts it to display the requested
							HTML
							page.
						</p>
						<p>By using HTTPS, the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks and data tampering is significantly
							reduced,
							ensuring a secure communication environment.</p>
